    <h3> hey! i'm areebah. this webpage is about my favourite person: </h3>
    <h1 class="thenuki"> thenuki! </h1>

    <h5 class="caption"> us filming an advert at school with our friends! yes, she is wearing a fake paper mustache. </h5>
    <h4>
      thenuki is my best friend. although i'm not supposed to say that because if she found out she would probably kill me. oops. if i miraculously disappear in the next few days then it's because she's seen this and murdered me. help!
    </h4>
    <p>
      we're in the same class at school and we sit next to each other in art, computing, german, music and geography. we're the same age but annoyingly, she's a whole three months older than me. i try not to mind too much though, because i know i would be a lot lonelier without her and she definitely makes school more interesting. half the time i'm laughing, it's because of her, and usually whatever i'm laughing my head off at isn't even funny, so there you go. animal magnetism is real. yay me.
      <br>
      <br>
      she listens to bands like lovejoy, twenty one pilots and annenmaykantereit, and she loves art (me too), maths (ew), video games (yay!), anime (some of them are cool), and me of course (well i hope she loves me).
      <br>
      <br>
      i'm very glad that i'm friends with her because she's the kind of person that's willing to run around in a fake paper mustache for 46 seconds to film an advert that has nothing to do with fake paper mustaches. aka she doesn't care what other people think about her (even if they think she's crazy for running around in a fake paper mustache). and she has lots of other friends (like pritika, aria and krishna who helped film the advert - thanks guys!) but i'm her best friend and i'm happy that i am.
